# Santa, Please!

## Wishlist webapp for the holidays

Santa, Please! Allows you to create wishlists with your favorite
products. You can submit your wishlist to your loved ones (in
the hopes to receive a present)

## Group 8

- Nathan Kim
- Edwin Peraza
- Ethan Ton
- Marl Rico

## Instructions for running the project

Use command:

```
- npm start
```

Sorry for the inconveniences. The project takes awhile to boot up, but it does load.

## More apologies:

The project runs and you can access the different pages, create a user, log in as the user.
When you log in you are redirected to the app dashboard. From there you can add data to
store it in PocketBase. However, I was not able to display the data on the screen.
